    <h1>Welcome to my Final Project Page</h1>
    <h1>View My Color By Number Gamebook:</h1>
    <p> The program I created is a holiday themed color by number book. The idea of the book is that, while the pictures are clear, each page will be a complete and vibrantly colored Christmas art piece by the time the user has completed each drawing. When the proram is first opened, the "cover" of our game book will be displayed. Throughout the entire game, a user may click "back" or "next" to easily navigate between pages. After opening the front cover, an instructions page will appear providing any clarifications or reminders on how the game will work. After the user has read the instructions and is ready to begin drawing they must press "next" in the bottom right corner and start their first drawing. Because the user is provided with "back" and "next" buttons on every page, they do not need to complete each drawing in order. So, flip through the pages and select whichever drawing you would like to start with. On each page, you are provided with 9 different color buttons, all of which are correctly numbered in corespondance with the drawings. You are also able to change the size of your drawing utensil. To do this, press "size +" for a larger cursor and "size -" to make it thinner. Once you have completed the entire book, a congratulations page will appear, prompting you to return back to the home page or keep drawing! </p>
