    <h1>Welcome to my Final Project Page</h1>
    <p> The program Adel and I created is a holiday themed color by number book! Every page will be a complete and vibrantly colored Christmas art piece by the time the user has completed all of the coloring tasks for each number. When the program is first opened, the "cover" of our digital game book will be displayed. Throughout the entire game, a user may click "back" or "next" in the bottom corners of their screen to easily navigate between pages. After clicking past our cover page, the instructions page will appear providing any clarifications or reminders on how the game will work. After the user has read the instructions and is ready to begin drawing they must press "next" in the bottom right corner to start their first drawing! Flip through the pages and select whichever drawing you would like to start with :) On each page, you are provided with 9 different color buttons, all of which are correctly numbered in corespondance with each of the drawings. You are also able to change the size of your drawing utensil. To do this, press "size +" for a larger cursor and "size -" to make it thinner. Once you have completed the entire book, a congratulations page will appear, prompting you to return back to the home page or go back and keep drawing! </p>
