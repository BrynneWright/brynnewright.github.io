    <h1>Welcome to my Final Project Page</h1>
    <h1>View My Color By Number Gamebook:</h1>
    <p> The program I created is a Holiday themed color by number book. The idea of the book is that, while the pictures are clear, each page will be a complete and vibrantly colored Christmas art piece by the time the user has completed each drawing. When the proram is first opened, the "cover"  of our game book will be displayed. Throughout the entire game, a user may click "back" or "next" to navigate between pages. After opening the front cover, an instructions page will appear providing any clarifications or reminders on how the game will work. After the user has read the instructions and is ready to begin drawing they must press "next" in the bottom right corner to begin their first drawing. Because the user is provided with "back" and "next" buttons on every page, they do not need t complete each drawing in order. So, flip through the pages and select whichever drawing you would like to begin with. </p>
