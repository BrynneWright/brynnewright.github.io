        <h1>About Me</h1>  
          <p> Hi! My name is Brynne Wright. I am a sophomore at the University of Rhode Island. My freshman year at URI I studied Industrial and Systems Engineering however, I am currently Undecided, but I am interested in Majoring or Minoring in Computer Science. I have one older brother who is a senior at Oklahoma State and is studying Industrial Engineering. (He is actually the reason I originally looked into the feild of engineering!) I grew up in Austin Texas and came to URI last year to play volleyball. I've always loved the northeast and wanted to experience a different part of the country throughout college. I grew up super active and was always trying different sports as a kid. I ultimatley fell in love with volleyball in middle school and have been playing competitively ever since! My dad played basketball in college which inspired me to want to follow in his footsteps and be a college athlete. A few things I like to do in my free time would be having game nights with friends, watching true crime documentaries, and playing Minecraft. </p>
          <P> Here's some pictures of me at the lake with friends, skiing, and playing volleyball! </p>
